# HitBoxesDemo
Creating custom hit boxes using javafx is actually fairly simple, just fallow along i and i will explain the process.

    The Interface
    
To create a ojcect with a hit box you are going to need 3 nodes: a ImageView, a Polygon, and a Pane. 

Using sceneBilder (highly recomended):
1. Drag a ImageView and a Polygon on the scene
2. Select both by holding ctrl and cliking on both nodes, then right click and select wrap in pane
3. Now add your Image to the ImageView
4. Cover the image with the Polygon the easiest way to do this is to set it's fill to transparent and use ctrl click to add points to the polygon the  drag the points to outline the shape of your picture
5. Done.

       The Code
